# Code usage

## Getting started
### requirements.txt
### hi-ml directory
### download LDM weights on `models/` directory
### data (???)

## LDM evaluation
perform phrase grounding with the LDM by running this script:

## BioViL(-T) evaluation
perform phrase grounding with either [BioViL](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.09817) or [BioViL-T](https://arxiv.org/abs/2301.04558) by running the following script:
